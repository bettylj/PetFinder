Project Title
 - PetFinder

Project Description 
 - PetFinder is a web application that matches pets from local animal shelters with people looking to own pets. We will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the website look and feel and user interactions, and SQL as our relational database to save user information and the pets they own. 

Vision Statement
 - Come and give your future companion a home!

Motivation
 - Adoption of pets from animal shelters is much better than buying pets from pet shop. To help provide people a way to find their future companion as well as giving pets in animal shelters a permanent home. Our aim is to act as an information bridge between animals and their potential owners.

Risks
 - All team members have no prior working experience with each other.
 - Have to coordinate meetings around our work,school and personal schedules.
   HTML,CSS and Javascript is new to one team member and one other is not quite as familiar with the use of all three in        conjunction.
 - Unfamiliar with the use of methodologies such as agile and sprint.
